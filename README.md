## **What are Helsinki City bikes?**

- "Helsinki City Bikes" is a public bicycle system in Helsinki and Espoo and integrating with the rest of the public transport in Helsinki since May 2016. Its aim is to solve the so called [last mile problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)).

- "Helsinki City Bikes" is operated as a public-private partnership between Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL), Helsinki City Transport (HKL), Espoo Technical and Environment Services, Moventia and Smoove.

- City bikes are shared bicycles available to everyone in Helsinki or Espoo. You can purchase access to city bikes for a day, week or the entire cycling season. All passes include an unlimited number of 30-minute bike rides. For a small extra fee, you can use the bike for longer, five hours at most. After use, the bike is returned to a bike station. You can register as a city bike user on the HSL city bikes webpage. A day pass user can get access to 1â€“4 bikes; other passes only include one bike.

- There are 3,510 bikes in season 2020. Helsinki has 241 and Espoo 110 bike stations.
